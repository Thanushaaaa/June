1.Ans-javac is used for compiling java files.It is present program/java/bin folder.
It converts .java file into .class file
java is used for running java files.It takes .class file as input.It is present in JRE

2.Ans-JDK-JDK stands for Java Development Kit.It contains JRE,JVM,tools and libraries/
JRE-Java Runtime Environment.JRE has JVM.JRE runs the code
JVM-Java Virtual Machine-JVM is in JRE.JVM is the one who actually executes the code.

3.Ans-Limitations of array:
1.Only same type of values should be stored in array
2.Array elements are accessed by using the index value of the elements
3.Array index value starts from 0
4.Data type for the array should be declared during its creation

4.Ans-Class-class is the blueprint/design that an object follows
      Object-object is the real world entity
	  class class_name{ }
	  
5.Ans-Array-Array is like a container that stores same kind of values in it
      Ex-int[] numbers={3,2,5,7,1};
	  
6.Ans-Difference between .java file and .class file:
1..java file is in human language that is understood only by the humans..java file is given as input to the JRE
   whereas .class file is understood by the machines.It can be run on any platform once it is generated.
   .class file makes java as platform independent
   
7.Ans-Length of given array is 6

8.Ans-non-access specifier return_type method_name()

9.Ans-Java is an object-oriented,platform independent programming language.
      It follows the concept of Write Once Run Anywhere.
	  
10.Ans-variable-variable stores the value.It acts like reference to that value in the memory.
       Types of varibles are:
	   1.Instance variable and class variable(or)
	   2.non-static variable and static variable
	   
11.Ans-A class variable has the 

12.Ans-data type shows what kind of data is stored
       Types of data types
	   1.primitive(short,byte,int,char,boolean,long,double,string)
	   2.non-primitive(class)
	   
13.Ans-Java features:
     1.Security
	 2.Object oriented
	 3.Platform independent
	 4.Robust
	 
	 
14.Ans-Types of array-int,string,long,byte,short.

15.Ans-array index out of bound exception arises when we try to access the element in the index that is 
    not present in the array
	
16.System.out.println is the statement written to print the output on the console
   System-predefined class
   dot operator
   out-static variable
   println-static method

17.double equal operator is used to check whether two values are equal or not

18.dot operator is used to access the members of the class

19.The class which contains main method is the base class of all the classes

      class,extends,implements,package,private,static,void,public,new,return
